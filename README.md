# Quiz 2: GeoJson Creation and Conversion

## Data Description
My geoJson file was converted from an Oregon counties shapefile which contained the boundaries of all of the counties within the state of Oregon. The normal geoJson file is in the WGS84, epsg: 4326 projection. The simplified file was converted from the original geoJson file using https://mapshaper.org/. The Visvalingam/weighted area method of simplification was used to simplify the geoJson file.

## Data Table
| File Name                       | Size (kb) |
|---------------------------------|-----------|
| ore_counties.geojson            | 2,160     |
